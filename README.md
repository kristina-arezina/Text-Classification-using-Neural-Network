# Text-Classification-using-Neural-Network

## ðŸ’¯ Motivation
While learning about NLP, specifically text classification, I followed adam0ling's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE6-FMiRajQ) regarding text classification using a Neural Network. 

## ðŸ–¥ Tech/Framework Used 

**Built with:**
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

**Data:**
The Twitter data for training this neural network came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140) 

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

- Training Accuracy: 0.9092
- Testing Accuracy:  0.7846

## ðŸ“š Application

Text classifiers can be used to organize, structure, and categorize pretty much any kind of text â€“ from documents, medical studies and files, and all over the web.
